## Overview

This module installs, configures and manages the service for the AWS Cloudwatch Logs Agent on Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Red Hat & CentOS EC2 instances.

## Module Description

CloudWatch Logs can be used to monitor your logs for specific phrases, values, or patterns. For example, you could set an alarm on the number of errors that occur in your system logs or view graphs of web request latencies from your application logs. You can view the original log data to see the source of the problem if needed. Log data can be stored and accessed for as long as you need using highly durable, low-cost storage so you donâ€™t have to worry about filling up hard drives.

## Setup

### What cloudwatchlogs affects

* The `awslogs` package.
* Configuration files under `/etc/awslogs`.
* The `awslogs` service.

### Beginning with cloudwatchlogs

The minimum you need to get this module up and running is (assuming your instance is launched with a suitable IAM role):

```puppet
include '::cloudwatchlogs'
```

## Usage

In addition to the minimum config above you can also declare which logs will be shipped to Cloudwatch Logs:

```puppet
class { 'cloudwatchlogs':
  logs                  => [
    { 'Messages' => '/var/log/messages' },
    { 'Secure'   => '/var/log/secure' },
    { 'Mail'     => '/var/log/maillog' },
  ],
  region                => 'eu-west-1',
  aws_access_key_id     => 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
  aws_secret_access_key => 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY',
}
```

## Reference

### `state_file`:

Defaults:

* Amazon Linux: `/var/lib/awslogs/agent-state`
* Other: `/var/awslogs/state/agent-state`

State file for the awslogs agent.

### `streamname`:

Default: `{instance_id}`

The name of the stream in Cloudwatch Logs.

### `logs`:

Default: `[ { 'Messages' => '/var/log/messages', }, { 'Secure' => '/var/log/secure', }, ]`

An array of hashes containing the 'name' & the 'path' of the log file(s) to be sent to Cloudwatch Logs.

### `datetime_formats`:

Default: `[]`    and datetime_format defaults to %b %d %H:%M:%S for all logs

An array of hashes containing the 'name' & the 'datetime format' of the log file(s) to be sent to Cloudwatch Logs.

Example for mongodb logs: 

```puppet
logs                  => [
 { 'system_messages'  => '/var/log/messages' },
 { 'mongod_logs'      => '/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log' },
 ],
 datetime_formats => [
   { 'mongod.log' => '%a %b %d %H:%M:%S.%f' },
 ],    
```

### `region`:

Default: `undef`

The region your EC2 instance is running in.

**NOTE:** This is required for none *Amazon* distros.

### `aws_access_key_id`:

Default: `undef`

The Access Key ID from the IAM user that has access to Cloudwatch Logs.

### `aws_secret_access_key`:

Default: `undef`

The Secret Access Key from the IAM user that has access to Cloudwatch Logs.

## Http Proxy Usage

If you have an http_proxy or https_proxy then run the following puppet code after calling cloudwatchlogs to modify the launcher script as a workaround bcause awslogs python code currently doesn't have http_proxy support:

```puppet
  $launcher = "#!/bin/sh
# Version: 1.3.5
echo -n $$ > /var/awslogs/state/awslogs.pid
/usr/bin/env -i AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/var/awslogs/etc/awscli.conf HOME=\$HOME HTTPS_PROXY=${http_proxy} HTTP_PROXY=${http_proxy} NO_PROXY=169.254.169.254  /bin/nice -n 4 /var/awslogs/bin/aws logs push --config-file /var/awslogs/etc/awslogs.conf >> /var/log/awslogs.log 2>&1
"

  file { '/var/awslogs/bin/awslogs-agent-launcher.sh':
    ensure  => file,
    owner   => root,
    group   => root,
    mode    => '0755',
    content => $launcher,
    require => Class['cloudwatchlogs'],
  }
```

NOTE: On Amazon Linux the AWS_CONFIG_FILE is /etc/awslogs/awscli.conf or if you are using AWS profile (which you should) then the AWS_CONFIG_FILE is not required. 

## Limitations

This module is currently only compatible with:

* Amazon Linux AMI 2014.09 or later.
* Ubuntu
* Red Hat
* CentOS

More information on support as well as information in general about the set-up of the Cloudwatch Logs agent can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/QuickStartEC2Instance.html).
